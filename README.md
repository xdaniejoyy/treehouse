### General notes
- Q1 uses the given dataset to solve.

- Q2 & Q3 uses sample data to solve.
The function `pascal_triangle` can run for larger layers efficiently.

- Q4 uses packages `yfinance` and `panda_datareader` to get Yahoo! data.
For the backtest, I implemented a risk-adjusted momentum strategy.
Several parameter variations are run, with Sharpe ratios and cumulative 
line charts plotted. 

- Q5 may require you to first run `brew install cloc`.
As sample data, it clones "https://github.com/python/devguide.git" 
to generate stats. This is not a big repository, don't worry.

- Q6 uses a sample text file in `data/sample_q6.txt`. 
This file contains edge cases such as invalid month/day values
and invalid month names.
